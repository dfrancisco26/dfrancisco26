Hi there, aloha, bonjour, hola! ðŸ‘‹ I'm David Francisco and I use pronouns he/him.
I'm a software dev based out of San Diego, and I run my own dog grooming business when I'm not wading waist-deep through code I wrote yesterday.
  
  I'm most passionate about games and stories. I gravitate towards creating new apps and ways for people to connect or immerse themselves in another world. I have used Node.js in combination with React and JavaScript as well as Python with Django, but I would love to learn more about the C language and why it's popular for game development.
  
  PROJECT: HYNT
  My first project was a choice-driven, browser-based game that utilized state to render different options to the user. In all, there were about 30 choices for the game, and I wrote the storyboard for those paths.

  PROJECT: DUNGEONS AND (maybe) DRAGONS
  My second project was one that utilized an API based on the "System Reference Documents" provided in Dungeons and Dragons called "Dungeons and (maybe) Dragons". It was primarily built to simplify the character creation process, taking more than 40+ places for input and simplifying it to race, class, and stats. It also includes a randomizer, for that REAL D&D experience.
  
  PROJECT: PIXIE.JS
  Pixie.js is a tarot card API highlighting the art of Pamela "Pixie" Colman Smith, with lots of routes and properties to sort the database by.
  
  I'm currently working on a portfolio site featuring Next.js as my primary framework. 
  
  I love infusing projects with my sense of humor and pop culture references, and am looking forward to collaborating with new people and new perspectives. Connect with me/hit me up if you want to talk RPGs, programming, food, Dnd or Magic!

Skills:
- Next.js
- React
- Node.js
- Test Driven Development
- PostgreSQL
- HTML/CSS
- Miro Board for planning
- Supabase
- Leadership and allocating resources/work
- Curiosity. This may or may not be a good thing.

Some âœ¨fun(?)âœ¨ facts about me:
- I joined the Navy before I had ever seen the ocean.
- I had built the quintessential "cow game" in C++ before going to school for web development.
- I hate the CSS property opacity. Alpha values rock!
- I didn't think I would enjoy design, but I really do.
- I write poetry and raps!

*ahem*
I bend HTML elements like the avatar Aang,
I love weird stuff like interrobangs,
Git clone, git push, I git that thang,
I be throwing out bytes like I got fangs.
This mic be a ternary, not null for eternity,
Chasing the currency, rich person table insert me.
I stay strict to my roots, like a kernal be,
I speak from the heart, near where my sternum be.

Thanks for visiting my page, feel free to ask questions, provide feedback, correct coding, etc!  ðŸ‘‹  ðŸ‘‹  ðŸ‘‹
